My name is Garrett Tinlin and this is my react project. The purpose of my project is to let the user add, delete, and modify any task. I used bootstrap for the Itemlist.js file. I have attached multiple css files to each of their own respective js files. The user should be able to add any task they would like and the task should show up on the list. Once you have finshed a task then there is way to crossout the task. We mainly used JavaScript in this project. One thing that I would like to work on is writing js code. I still do not have the hang of it and I used w3school to help with my writing. Secondly, I would like to work on how to understand what it is that I am coding. So many times I am writing code for JS and I know what should be typed next but I do not know why. I would like to learn how to read code better. The last thing I would like to work on is linking the correct files to the correct pages. I had a hard time navigating the pages to see where things should end up.
