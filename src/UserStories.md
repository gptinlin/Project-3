1. The users should be able to use this app for making grocery lists. Lets say before the user goes to the store they want to be able to open the app and easily access the app so that a list appears as they type out all the fruits, vegetables, and meat they want to buy. This will make grocery shopping much easier. The user should be able to add as much as they want and if they mess up, they should be able to delete that item off the list.

2. The user needs an app that can create a list for all the thigs that I have to do today. And when the user is done they should be able to cross them off the list so they do not have to worry about them again. But the user also wants to be able to go back and see that they did their task. No matter how many tasks they have to do that day, the user wants to be able to list them all. This will save them time because then they will not have to worry about forgetting the simpler tasks.

3. The user of the app needs to create a list of all the people that will be attending the schools' fundraiser. The user should be able to open the app and start writing down all the names of the people attending. Once they are done with all the names, they will be able to cross the names off the list once the guest start appearing and modify the guest list if more people are donating and want to show up to the fundraiser event.
